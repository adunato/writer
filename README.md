# Writer: An Extension for Text Generation Web UI
![Logo](./logo.png)

Writer is an open-source AI writing application designed to provide seamless interaction with large language models (LLMs). Crafted with the idea of bridging the gap between advanced AI technologies and user-friendly interfaces, it brings a unique feature set for automatic text generation, summarisation, and seamless exporting options. 

## Key Features :key:

- **Summary Support**: Write or paste a story summary in the provided editor. This will provide necessary context to the LLM, assisting in generating content more aligned with your thoughts.

- **Auto-Summarisation of Chapters**: Why read the entire chapter when you can get its crisp version? Writer auto-summarises chapters, providing you with their essence without the extensive details.

- **Auto-Collation of Chapters**: Get your chapters organised automatically into a compiled story. No more hassle of manual compilation.

- **Export Options**: Finished writing? Export your masterpiece to HTML, Markdown, or txt format.

## How To Use :book:

### Writer Pad :memo:

The Writer Pad is your primary workspace. It functions similarly to the Notebook mode in Text Generation Web UI. Use this text box to write, edit, and generate text as per your needs.

### Session :floppy_disk:

The Session feature allows you to save and load sessions, including content from the Writer Pad, Summary, and Compiled Story. Now, working across multiple sessions is just a click away.

### Story Generation :rocket:

Story Generation is where the real magic happens. It allows editing the story summary and provides a view of the 'Latest Context' sent to the LLM. By viewing the context used by the LLM to generate text, you get a better understanding of how your input influences the output.

### Settings :gear:

Configure your text generation and summarisation settings. The summarisation function uses the model currently loaded. However, these settings are isolated from the text generation settings, allowing you to fine-tune them without interference.
